Details of the work done by Team Normies for the IBM TechXchange Pre-Conference WatsonX Hackathon under the path:
“Build a generative AI application for a use case supporting productivity with IBM watsonx.ai, featuring IBM Granite.”

The project has been built primarily in Python using LangChain and the IBM WatsonX Granite models.

❓ What is CogniForm?

CogniForm is an AI-powered SaaS solution built on IBM WatsonX Granite models designed to tackle the problem of survey burnout in workplaces.

Organizations rely on surveys and forms for employee feedback, HR workflows, and internal processes. But constant requests overwhelm employees, resulting in low response rates, poor data quality, and wasted productivity.

Our solution introduces agentic AI to batch, prioritize, and auto-complete routine surveys, ensuring only the most critical ones reach employees—reducing fatigue and improving engagement.

🎯 Why CogniForm?

We built this solution with a clear mission:
➡️ Help employees to reclaim their time while ensuring organizations still get the high-quality insights they need.

Instead of employees drowning in repetitive surveys, our AI agent acts as a smart filter + assistant that:

Collects all survey requests

Eliminates duplicates

Auto-fills repetitive responses securely

Sends only essential, high-priority surveys to the employee

This saves time, energy, and mental bandwidth, while making workplace feedback smarter, not harder.

🚀 Features

For this hackathon, we implemented three core modules that showcase how agentic AI can reduce survey fatigue:

1. Smart Batching & Prioritization

Groups multiple survey/form requests into a single, optimized batch

Flags urgent/high-priority forms first

Reduces interruptions and context switching
⏳ Employees spend less time juggling endless forms

2. AI Auto-completion with IBM Granite

Learns from previous responses to auto-fill repetitive survey questions

Granite-powered natural language processing ensures context-aware answers

Employees can quickly review + approve before submission
⚡ Faster responses without compromising personalization

3. Analytics Dashboard

Tracks survey fatigue indicators such as frequency, response time, and completion rates

Helps organizations adjust survey frequency and content for better engagement
📊 Clear visibility into survey health across the workforce

🙌 Conclusion

CogniForm is just the beginning. Our vision is to create a global productivity solution that improves workplace efficiency, reduces burnout, and empowers organizations to gather smarter, higher-quality data—all powered by IBM WatsonX AI.

While this is currently a proof-of-concept, the potential to scale across industries is massive, from HR teams to enterprise workflows.

We’re excited to continue building and refining this platform—and to demonstrate the true power of agentic AI in solving everyday workplace challenges.

Thank you for checking out our project, and we look forward to seeing you at the IBM TechXchange Hackathon finals in Orlando! 🌍
